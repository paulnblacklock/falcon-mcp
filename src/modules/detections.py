            filter: Filter detections using a query in Falcon Query Language (FQL) An asterisk wildcard * includes all results. You must use FQL and never use JSON.
            limit: The maximum number of detections to return in this response (default: 100; max: 9999). Use with the offset parameter to manage pagination of results.
            offset: The first detection to return, where 0 is the latest detection. Use with the limit parameter to manage pagination of results.
            q: Search all detection metadata for the provided string.
            sort: Sort detections using these options:
                timestamp: Timestamp when the alert occurred
                created_timestamp: When the alert was created
                updated_timestamp: When the alert was last modified
                severity: Severity level of the alert (1-100, recommended when filtering by severity)
                confidence: Confidence level of the alert (1-100)
                agent_id: Agent ID associated with the alert

                Sort either asc (ascending) or desc (descending).
                Both formats are supported: 'severity.desc' or 'severity|desc'

                When searching for high severity alerts, use 'severity.desc' to get the highest severity alerts first.
                For chronological ordering, use 'timestamp.desc' for most recent alerts first.

                Examples: 'severity.desc', 'timestamp.desc'
            include_hidden: Whether to include hidden detections (default: True). When True, shows all detections including previously hidden ones for comprehensive visibility.

        🚀 USAGE EXAMPLES:

        # Find new endpoint protection detections sorted by severity
        search_detections("status:'new'+product:'epp'", limit=50, sort="severity.desc")

        # Find high-confidence XDR detections from last week
        search_detections("product:'xdr'+confidence:>80+created_timestamp:>'2024-01-15T00:00:00Z'", limit=25)

        # Find unassigned detections across all products
        search_detections("assigned_to_name:!*", limit=100, sort="timestamp.desc")

        # Find OverWatch detections with specific tactics
        search_detections("product:'overwatch'+tactic:'Initial Access'", limit=50)

        # Find detections that need immediate attention
        search_detections("(status:'new'),(status:'reopened')+confidence:>75", sort="timestamp.desc")

        ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES:
        • Use single quotes around string values: 'value'
        • Use square brackets for exact matches: ['exact_value']
        • Date format must be UTC: 'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ'
        • Status values are: new, in_progress, closed, reopened
        • Product filtering enables product-specific detection analysis
        • Confidence values range from 1-100
        • Complex queries may take longer to execute
        • include_hidden parameter shows previously hidden detections
