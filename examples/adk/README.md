# Running/Deploying with a prebuilt agent

This repository includes a prebuilt [Google ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/) based agent integrated with the `falcon-mcp` server.

The goal is to provide customers an opinionated and validated set of instructions for running falcon-mcp and deploying it for their teams.

### Setting up and running locally (5 minutes)
You can run the following commands locally on Linux / Mac or in Google Cloud Shell.
If you plan to deploy the agent, it is recommended to run in Google Cloud Shell.

```bash

git clone https://github.com/CrowdStrike/falcon-mcp.git

cd falcon-mcp

cd examples/adk

# create and activate python environment
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate

# install depenencies
pip install -r falcon_agent/requirements.txt

chmod +x adk_agent_operations.sh

./adk_agent_operations.sh

```



The script will create `.env` file in `falcon_agent/` directory and prompt you to update it. At a minimum update the `General Agent Configuration` section.


<details>

<summary><b>Sample Output - Very First Run</b></summary>

```bash
./adk_agent_operations.sh
INFO: No operation mode provided and './falcon_agent/.env' is not found.
INFO: Attempting to copy template './falcon_agent/env.properties' to './falcon_agent/.env'.
SUCCESS: './falcon_agent/env.properties' copied to './falcon_agent/.env'.
ACTION REQUIRED: Please update the variables in './falcon_agent/.env' before running this script with an operation mode.

```
</details>

<br>

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure you get and update the GOOGLE_API_KEY using these [instructions](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key).

Now run the script with `local_run` parameter.


```bash
# local run
./adk_agent_operations.sh local_run
```



Here is the sample output


<details>

<summary><b>Sample Output - Local Run</b></summary>

```
</details>

<br>

You can access the agent on http://localhost:8000 üöÄ

> If running in the Google Cloud Shell - please use the web preview with port 8000.

You can stop the agent with `ctrl+C`


### Deployment - Why Deploy?
You may want to deploy the agent (with the `falcon-mcp` server) for following reasons

1. You do not want to hand out credentials to everyone to run MCP server locally
2. You want to share the ready to use agent with your team
3. Use it for demos without any setup

You have two distinct paths to deployment:
1. Deploy on Cloud Run
2. Deploy on Vertex AI Agent Engine (and access through Agentspace after registration)

<br>

> [!NOTE]
> For all the following sections - If you are not running in Google Cloud Shell, make sure you have `gcloud` CLI [installed](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) and you have authenticated with your username (preferably as owner of the project) on your local computer.

### Deploying the agent to Cloud Run

This section covers deployment to cloud run. Make sure you have all the required [APIs enabled](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/quickstarts/build-and-deploy/deploy-python-service#before-you-begin) on the GCP project.

```bash
cd examples/adk/
./adk_agent_operations.sh cloudrun_deploy
```

In the sample output below, note the lines marked with ‚û°Ô∏è

1. You will have to provide input for `Allow unauthenticated invocations?` (say N)
2. Once deployment is completed you get a URL to access your agent.

</details>

<br>

> [!NOTE]
> By default the service has IAM authentication enabled for it. Please follow steps below to enable access to yourself and your team.


1. Cloud Run - Services - select `falcon-agent-service`, by clicking the checkbox next to it.
2. At the top click `permissions`, a pane `Permissions for falcon-agent-service` should open on the right hand side.
3. Click `Add principal`
4. Add the users you want to provide access to and provide them `Cloud Run Invoker` role.
5. Wait for some time.

**Accessing the service**

1. Ask your users to run the following command (replace project id and region with the project id & region in which you have deployed the service)

```bash
gcloud run services proxy falcon-agent-service --project PROJECT-ID --region YOUR-REGION
```

<details>

<summary><b>Sample Output Accessing Cloud Run service through local proxy</b></summary>


```bash
# You might be asked to install a component, for the proxy to work locally

```
</details>

2. Now they can access the Cloud Run Service locally on `http://localhost:8080`

### Deploying to Vertex AI Agent Engine and registering on Agentspace

This section covers deployment to Vetex AI Agent Engine. To acces the agent and to consolidate all your agents under one umbrella you can also register the deployed agent to Agentspace.

1. Make sure that you create a bucket for staging the Agent Engine artifacts in the same project as the deployment (env variable - `AGENT_ENGINE_STAGING_BUCKET`).

```bash
cd examples/adk/
./adk_agent_operations.sh agent_engine_deploy
```

And here is the sample output.

Make sure you copy the Agent Engine Number from the output (marked by ‚û°Ô∏è for illustration)

Once the agent is deployed on Agent Engine, you can register it on Agentspace to work with an Agent Engine Application.

Make sure you have the Agent Engine Number from the previous step


1. Go to the Agentspace [page](https://console.cloud.google.com/gen-app-builder/engines) in Google Cloud Console.
2. Create an App (Type - Agentspace)
3. Note down the app details including the app name (e.g. google-security-agent-app_1750057151234)
4. Make sure that you have the Agent Space Admin role while performing the following actions
5. Enable Discovery Engine API for your project
6. Provide the following roles to the Discovery Engine Service Account
   - Vertex AI viewer
   - Vertex AI user
7. Please note that these roles need to be provided into the project housing your Agent Engine Agent. Also you need to enable the show Google provided role grants to access the Discovery Engine Service Account.

Update the environment variables `PROJECT_NUMBER`, `AGENT_LOCATION`, `REASONING_ENGINE_NUMBER` and `AGENT_SPACE_APP_NAME` in the `# Agentspace Specific` section.

Now to register the agent and make it available to your application use the following command.

```bash
cd examples/adk/
./adk_agent_operations.sh agentspace_register
```

</details>

Now you can access the agent in the Agentspace application you created earlier.

### Securing access, Evaluating, Optimizing performance and costs

#### Securing access
  1. For local runs make sure that you are not using a shared machine
  2. For Cloud Run deployment you can use - [Control access on an individual service or job](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/securing/managing-access#control-service-or-job-access) - that is the default behavior for this deployment.
  3. For agent running in Agentspace - you can provide access (Predefined role - `Discovery Engine User`) selectively by navigating to Agentspace-Apps-Your App -Integration-Grant Permissions.

#### Evaluating
It is advised to evaluate the agent for the trajectory it takes and the output it produces - you can use [ADK documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/evaluate/) to evaluate this agent. You can also test with different models.

#### Optimizing performance and costs
Various native performance improvements are already part of the codebase. You can further optimize the performance and reduce the LLM costs by controlling the value of the environment variable `MAX_PREV_USER_INTERACTIONS`. You can test how many previous conversations (instead of ALL conversations by default) work for your use case (recommended 5). You can also use the appropriate [Gemini Model](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models#model-variations) for both cost and performance optimizations.
